The bot will have the following commands (along with the required permissions 
to access those commands):

Two main roles needed:
1. Admin - Managing the bot and pushing data to the spreadsheet
admin rank is called "mod"


!help 
-----
Requires admin or user rank
This will print out all the functions that a user can do based on their role


!update <user> <amount>
-----
Requires admin rank
This will add <amount> to the <user>'s split. 
<amount> will need to be an integer value with no commas (e.g. 100000 not 100,000)
<user> can just be their RSN or can be a ping to that user 
    (Note: if <user> is a ping to that user, their nickname on the server must 
     match their RSN)



!add_user <user> <amount>
-----
Requires admin rank
Similar to !add, but this will create a brand new user and give them the split
If <amount> is left out, it will be assumed as 0




!split <user>
------
Requires admin or user rank
Responds with the amount of split a user has from the spreadsheet
if <user> is left out, it tries to get the caller's info
if <user> is a ping, it will try to reference their nickname
otherwise, <user> should match whats in
